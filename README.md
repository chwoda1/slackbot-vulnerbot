### STATUS: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/crw5996/slackbot-vulnerbot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/crw5996/slackbot-vulnerbot)	


### USE:
	Currently, vulnerbot can only understand a very small set of commands and is very inflexible. However, this should
	change over time. It currently will answer...
	
	1.) @vulnerbot obtain all {low|medium|high} exploitability issues (if none specified, default is high)
	2.) @vulnerbot obtain all exploits targeting {manufacturers}
	3.) @vulnerbot is this ip malicious? {ip}
	4.) @vulnerbot is this email spam? {email}
	5.) @vulnerbot what is your name? 


### NOTE:
	Starting with four questions, I knew I wanted the first two questions to be in depth, very useful data that may require some reading. 
	If someone was researching apple security flaws or wanted a list of high profile vulnerabilities, they could get a comprehensive list 
	of them quickly. With the remaining two questions, I wanted them to be mainly a quick yes or no question. Instead of having to google 
	search something, they could have a yes or no answer in seconds. 

	One data set I am looking forward to implementing is the Intel Botnet tracker data feed. Unfortunately the stream is down right now, but I 
	will add it as soon as it's up
